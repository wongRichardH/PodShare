# PodShare

<br>
PodShare allows users and their friends to upload and share audio synchronously.
<br>
Users can record audio, then upload their files to Firebase, where added friends can listen to its content.
<br>
To use, clone/download this repo and authenticate with Firebase to begin sharing audio.
